Have you ever wanted to know the longest possible route you could have in the tabletop game Ticket to Ride using only
one color of card, assuming you had unlimited cards available in that color and unlimited train cars?

No?

Well, this Python script will calculate the answer for you anyway.

`ttr.dat` can be easily modified to calculate the longest route in expansions or sequels to the original game.
